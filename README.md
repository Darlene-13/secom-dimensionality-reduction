## SEMI-CONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING PROCESS PREDICTION/FAULT DETECTION
> It's a dataset from a real semiconductor manufacturing process where the goal is yield prediction / fault detection — figuring out which wafers pass or fail quality control based on hundreds of sensor readings.

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
1. 590 sensor signals collected from the wafer fabrication line
2. Most signals are noisy, irrelevant, or correlated with each other
3. Goal: find the small subset of signals that actually predict pass/fail (the -1 and 1 labels in the target file)
4. Real business impact: reduce scrap rate, cut costs, increase throughput.
